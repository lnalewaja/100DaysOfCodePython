# 100DaysOfCode-Python
In this repository, I will work through the Udemy Course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023". 

The course contains 100 days of coding projects that will progress in difficulty as you learn more skills to implement.
While completing this course, I will learn skills in all areas of programming such as game development and web development.
Each project that is completed for each day will be added to this repository as a way to track my Python progress.
